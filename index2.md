## Summary

The financial incentives for adding solar panels to your home have become so good for DC residents that you can now get solar panels installed on your home that you own outright and that are free.  I'll explain more below, but again, you can get solar panels on your house that you own and that you get the energy from, for free.      
  
To be clear, I'm just an enthusiastic fan of solar panels and good deals, and it has only been in the last few years that the incentives have gotten to this point, so if you haven't heard this before, it's understandable.  I have no ties to any solar companies and I don't get any financial benefit if you follow any of this advice or get solar for your house in any way.  More people installing solar on their homes is good for us all from a climate standpoint, but I genuinely think that this is a particularly good deal for homeowners in DC aside from all of that and really just want everybody to know about it.  I give my background and explain this thinking more below.    


## The Finances, In Summary

There are four financial benefits when you install solar panels on your home:    
  
1) A lower power bill - The solar energy generated by your panels lowers your monthly electric costs.    
2) Increased home value - Having solar panels installed on a home increases its value by $10,000-$20,000.    
3) A federal tax credit - You receive a federal income tax credit worth $26% of installing the panels.   
4) Solar credits - When the panels are installed, you begin to receive solar credits called SRECs that have value and can be sold.  Alternatively, you can sell the rights to your credits for a lump sum up front.    
  
#1 and #2 are helpful, but they don't help any with the upfront cost of installing solar panels on your home, so we'll focus on #3 and #4.  **The recent shift that is so important is that several solar installation companies value the solar credits so much that they will buy them off of you for 74% of the cost of installation, making the entire purchase free, as of the next tax day.**    
  
I'll describe this in round numbers here and then go into a lot more detail below.  Let's say that this November, you get solar panels installed on your home from one of the companies that offer this arrangement.  The cost of the installation is $20,000, but the company wants to buy the rights to your solar credits for $15,000.  Therefor, you pay $5,000 to install them so for the moment, you are out $5,000, but you own the panels outright and are now getting free electricity from the sun.  When you file your taxes this spring, you receive a $5,000 credit on your federal income taxes.  So by the time your tax refund comes back in the spring, it is as if you paid $0 to get solar installed on your home.
